# FaceDetector
To run project:
(1)Type "make" into the terminal while inside the build, to have the project built to save each edit
(2)Then run the built project by entering "./MyProject" as this is the name the project is built under

Future Plans:
(1)Have a button that asks the user  if they want to save a face
(2)When clicked the computer will save the current frame image and store that frame
as a reference face
(3)The user can then enter a name(possibly more details) to store the image with
(4)Whenever this face is recognized the name of the saved face will appear on the screen as well
